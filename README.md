# RhythmWare

Our project is going to consist of a rhythm game (possibly with several modes) in which the player can either:
* Catch notes in a "basket" which is rotated along a circular play area. Notes radiate from the center of the play area and the player must catch them before they leave the play area.
* Press buttons in time with the music to "hack-n-slash" blocks that are coming towards the player character. A take on the "scrolling rhythm game" subgenre.

Our project will be programmed in Java. As it stands currently we are going to be adding GUI elements (interactable menus to select different modes, difficulties, etc.), programming the mode in which the team agrees on the most first, and creating mutable options within the game so that it is customizable in some way (speed of notes can be as fast / slow as you want, BPM, etc.). We are also looking into the possibility of adding "hold" notes (notes in which the player needs to hold a button / sustain a position for a period of time instead of just performing one quick action).
