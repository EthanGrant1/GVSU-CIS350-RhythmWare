Team name: RhythmWare

Members present: Ethan Grant, David Geisel, Roman Brancato

Date: 10-31-2021 (Happy Halloween! c:)

Time: ~6:00 - 6:40PM

Discussion points: 

* Fixing of graphical issues (combo increasing on every frame, judgments not reendering properly)
* What is coming next in our project (iteration of graphics, creating song charts etc.)
* Status update on the Song Menu portion of the GUI

Goals for next week (include responsibilities)

* Touch base on the Song Menu and possibly get it finalized (Roman Brancato)
* Possibly begin fleshing out graphics and use images instead of drawing to the screen (Brian Turnbo (Mockup / Design) & Ethan Grant (Design / Implementation)) 
* Figure out what we're going to need for song charting and audio (classes / imports / refactoring code / etc.)
* (Some of this may bleed into next week if it gets to be a lot)
