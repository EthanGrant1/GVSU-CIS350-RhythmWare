## Meeting minutes template

Team name: RhythmWare

Members present: Roman Brancato, Ethan Grant, David Geisel

Date: 11-11-2021

Time: 6:13 - 7:35 (approximately 1 hour 22 minutes)

Discussion points: 

* Song menu changes (Assets folder, backgrounds, preview, etc)
* Audio player added (JLayer audio library added)
* Refactoring and folder structure to get everything consistent and easier to navigate

Goals for next week (include responsibilities)

* Note: We are putting graphics on hold as there are many more important features that we want to ensure are properly working first (as graphics are a lower priority thing on our list and if we don't iterate on graphics, we can just use placeholder graphics to ensure that the prototype is in proper working order first).
* Finish adding buttons and formatting to the song select menu (Roman Brancato)
* Add charting timing to the Beat Keepers (Ethan Grant)
