# Docs Folder

This folder contains a lot of various things that were produced during the software engineering process.

## Presentations

There are 2 presentations that were produced over the course of the semester. One was for midterm time and the other was for the end of the semester. Each presentation goes over the game so far (relative to that point in the semester).

## Software Specs

There are some software requirements specifications (or SRS) in this folder. They are essentially a roadmap of features that are to be implemented in our design. They are divided into two categories. The functional requirements are the ones that are more concrete. They are specific implementation requirements that dig more into how something is going to be coded. The non-functional requirements are more generalized. They are higher level implementation ideas on what the final product is going to be like.
