# Introduction

Our project is going to consist of a rhythm game. The main structure of the game is going to be as follows:

The player is in a play area of some kind. "Notes" (what are considered to be the main object and core objective of the game) will make their way towards the player. The player's goal is to interact with the notes in some way (whether that be through mouse, keyboard or some other control method) such that the notes don't hit the player or leave the player area. The player will be scored based on number of notes hit, and whether or not the player character hasn't "died" (i.e., the player lets too many notes leave the play area and thus has lost the game due to a lack of health or power meter of some kind). 

The "type" (or subgenre) or rhythm game that we are going to create is currently up for debate, as there are many different types which vary in scope, control, mechanical development, etc. The current types that are up for consideration are as follows:

- Scrolling rhythm game: A game in which the notes are on a "track" which is directed towards the player. The player is stationary and the notes fly towards the player, where they must interact with them once they reach a specific region in front of the player character. A possible statistic that could be tracked is the "accuracy level" of the actions that the player performs. There is a specific region in front of the player character in which a note is registered as hit, and is therefore not active after the action. The timing in which this action occurs (i.e., the action occurs too early and the note is in front of the immediate action region, the action occurs too late and the note is behind the immediate action region, or the action occurs perfectly timed and the is perfectly inside the action region). Players could be assigned a specific score value based on how well the notes were timed (i.e., 50 for poor timing, 100 for close to perfect timing, and 300 for perfect timing).

- Radial rhythm game: A game in which the play area is circular, and notes "radiate" outwards towards the edge of the circular play area. The player contols a "basket" (a small region outside of the cicle that is a portion of the sector taken from a specific angle from the center of the play area) and tries to catch the notes in the basket. Accuracy in this game could be tracked based on how close to the center of the basket a player caught a note.. 

# Anticipated Technologies

We are anticipating that this project will be built in Java.

# Method/Approach

Our method and approach involves creating a basic version of the specific type of rhythm game that the team most agrees on. We will begin with simplistic representation of objects (simple shapes and graphics) and create the minimum of what is required to create that specific game. If time allows, we may introduce other mechanics that will further increase the complexities of the game, iterating on ideas and see what works and what doesn't work. (See "Estimated Timeline" for a more in depth explanation of the mechanic roadmap).
