# Artifacts Folder

This is a folder where all of our software artifacts are located. In it we have some concept art (drawn by Brian Turnbo), as well as some use case diagrams that we designed during the software engineering process. This folder may give you some insight as to the different ideas that we had when trying to design our game. It's interesting to see how the ideas that we had near the beginning of the semester compare to the final product at the end of the semster.

## Concepts

Includes some concept art for 3 screens (the Main Menu, the Options Menu, and the Song Select Menu).

## use_case_diagrams

Includes use case diagrams for 3 aspects of our project (the main gameplay aspects, the Options Menu, and the Song Select).
